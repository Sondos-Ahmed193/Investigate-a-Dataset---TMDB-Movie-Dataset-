# Investigate a Dataset (TMDB Movie Dataset) #
## Overview ##
The primary goal of the project is to go through the dataset and the general data analysis process using numpy, pandas and matplotlib.This contain four parts:

## Table of Contents ##
* Introduction
* Data Wrangling and Data Cleaning
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Conclusions


## Introduction ##
I choose the TMDb movie data set for data analysis. This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.I would like to find other intresting patterns in the dataset.

Contain:

* Total Rows = 10866
* Total Columns = 21
* After Seeing the dataset we can say that some columns is contain null values

## Data Wrangling ##
After Observing the dataset and the questions related to this dataset for the analysis we will be keeping only relevent data and deleting the unused data.

## Data Cleaning (Removing The Unused Information From The Dataset) ##

* Information That We Need To Delete Or Modify
* We need to remove duplicate rows from the dataset
* Changing format of release date into datetime format
* Remove the unused colums that are not needes in the analysis process.
* Remove the movies which are having zero value of budget and revenue.


## Exploratory Data Analysis ##
> Tip: Now that you've trimmed and cleaned your data, you're ready to move on to exploration. Compute statistics and create visualizations with the goal of addressing the research questions that you posed in the Introduction section. It is recommended that you be systematic with your approach. Look at one variable at a time, and then follow it up by looking at relationships between variables.

### Question 1: ###
What features are associated with the most popularity movies?
### Question 2: ###
What are the properties which effect on increased revenue?


Basically, I analysis  for  only two questions in the future I will add more research questions.
